# roc_misc_tests

This crate contains tests about some files in this
repository that don't really belong in any other crate.

If some tests of this crate fail, you may be able to
automatically fix the detected problems by running:

    SNAPSHOTS=overwrite cargo test -p roc_misc_tests

## Autogenerated table of contents in .md files

1. Insert the following lines where you want the TOC to be generated:

   ```
   <!-- START autogenerated TOC -->
   <!-- END autogenerated TOC -->
   ```

2. Add the path of the file to [md_files_with_a_toc.txt](md_files_with_a_toc.txt).

3. Run `cargo update-md-toc`.
